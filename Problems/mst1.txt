Problem Statement:
Write a C++ program that implements Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a given undirected graph. The program should take input representing a set of points in a 2D plane and construct a weighted graph where each point is a vertex, and the weight of each edge is the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points. Finally, the program should output the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

The program should include the following functionalities:
1. Implement Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the input graph.
2. Accept input for the number of points and their coordinates.
3. Compute the distance between each pair of points to construct the weighted graph.
4. Output the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

The program should follow these steps:
1. Accept the number of points from the user.
2. Prompt the user to enter the x and y coordinates for each point.
3. Construct the weighted graph based on the distances between points.
4. Implement Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree.
5. Output the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

Note: The program should include necessary error handling and ensure efficient memory usage.
